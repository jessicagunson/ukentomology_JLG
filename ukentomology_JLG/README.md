# ukentomology_JLG

A package for identifying and locating entomological specimens at UK museums.
This package has compiled entomology specimen collection data from the London
Museum of Natural History and the Royal Albert Memorial Museum, specifically
specimens of the Lepidoptera order. Users are able to load in a dataframe of 
relevant information, as well as re-pull the information from the individual
APIs if desired. The package also allows users to generate simple summary 
statistics regarding the type and quantity of specimens available at the
museum locations.
